# Simple-bouncing-ball-exercise-in-JS-

Simple bouncing ball exercise I did as part of a web development bootcamp using some basic JS. The ball moves randomly inside a defined square on the screen. The bouncing angle is random and speed of movement are random.

Add other balls and some "obstacles" (ie, other shapes);
Add controls keys for the moving balls and create a game where the balls must avoid both obstacles and each other;
